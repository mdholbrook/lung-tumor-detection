# Analysis of Lung Tumor Detection

The code in this folder analyzes the datasets before and after processing. Statistics about the tumors in the data are computed via `compute_label_statistics.py`, and detection statistics are calculated at each decision threshold for each type of network trained in `analysis_with_thresholds.py`.
